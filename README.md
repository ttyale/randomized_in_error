# randomized_in_error
This folder includes the simulation code for Tong G., Coronado, GD., Li C., and Li F. "Randomized in Error."  The code provides simulation results for treatment effect estimation under randomization in error. 
"simulation_code_riec_model.R" includes the simulation code when randomized-in-error outcomes in the treatment arm is unobserved. 
"simulation_code_riec_model_nomiss.R" includes the simulation code when randomized-in-error outcomes in the treatment arm is unobserved.
